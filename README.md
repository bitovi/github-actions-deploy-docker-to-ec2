# Docker to AWS VM

GitHub action to deploy any [Docker](https://www.bitovi.com/academy/learn-docker.html)-based app to an AWS VM (EC2) using Docker and Docker Compose.

The action will copy this repo to the VM and then run `docker-compose up`.

## Getting Started Intro Video

## Requirements

1. Files for Docker
2. An AWS account

### 1. Files for Docker
Your app needs a `Dockerfile` and a `docker-compose.yaml` file.

> For more details on setting up Docker and Docker Compose, check out Bitovi's Academy Course: [Learn Docker](https://www.bitovi.com/academy/learn-docker.html)
>

### 2. An AWS account
You'll need [Access Keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/userguide/pstools-appendix-sign-up.html) from an [AWS account](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/create-and-activate-aws-account/)

## Environment variables

For envirnoment variables in your app, you can provide:
 - `repo_env` - A file in your repo that contains env vars
 - `ghv_env` - An entry in [Github actions variables](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/variables)
 - `dot_env` - An entry in [Github secrets](https://docs.github.com/es/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets)
 - `aws_secret_env` - The path to a JSON format secret in AWS
 
Then hook it up in your `docker-compose.yaml` file like:

```
version: '3.9'
services:
  app:
    env_file: .env
```

These environment variables are merged to the .env file quoted in the following order:
 - Terraform passed env vars ( This is not optional nor customizable )
 - Repository checked-in env vars - repo_env file as default. (KEY=VALUE style)
 - Github Secret - Create a secret named DOT_ENV - (KEY=VALUE style)
 - AWS Secret - JSON style like '{"key":"value"}'

## Example usage

Create `.github/workflow/deploy.yaml` with the following to build on push.

### Basic example
```yaml
name: Basic deploy
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  EC2-Deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - id: deploy
        uses: bitovi/github-actions-deploy-docker-to-ec2@v0.4.6
        with:
          aws_access_key_id: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
          aws_secret_access_key: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
          aws_default_region: us-east-1
          dot_env: ${{ secrets.DOT_ENV }}
```

### Advanced example

```yaml
name: Advanced deploy
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

permissions:
  contents: read

jobs:
  EC2-Deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    environment:
      name: ${{ github.ref_name }}
      url: ${{ steps.deploy.outputs.vm_url }}
    steps:
    - id: deploy
      name: Deploy
      uses: bitovi/github-actions-deploy-docker-to-ec2@v0.4.6
      with:
        aws_access_key_id: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
        aws_secret_access_key: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
        aws_session_token: ${{ secrets.AWS_SESSION_TOKEN }}
        aws_default_region: us-east-1
        domain_name: bitovi.com
        sub_domain: app
        tf_state_bucket: my-terraform-state-bucket
        dot_env: ${{ secrets.DOT_ENV }}
        ghv_env: ${{ vars.VARS }}
        app_port: 3000
        additional_tags: "{\"key1\": \"value1\",\"key2\": \"value2\"}"

```

## Note about resource identifiers

Most resources will contain the tag GITHUB_ORG-GITHUB_REPO-GITHUB_BRANCH, some of them, even the resource name after. 
We limit this to a 60 characters string because some AWS resources have a length limit and short it if needed.

We use the kubernetes style for this. For example, kubernetes -> k(# of characters)s -> k8s. And so you might see some compressions are made.

For some specific resources, we have a 32 characters limit. If the identifier length exceeds this number after compression, we remove the middle part and replace it for a hash made up from the string itself. 

### S3 buckets naming

Buckets names can be made of up to 63 characters. If the length allows us to add -tf-state, we will do so. If not, a simple -tf will be added.

## CERTIFICATES - Only for AWS Managed domains with Route53

As a default, the application will be deployed and the ELB public URL will be displayed.

If `domain_name` is defined, we will look up for a certificate with the name of that domain (eg. `example.com`). We expect that certificate to contain both `example.com` and `*.example.com`. 

If you wish to set up `domain_name` and disable the certificate lookup, set up `no_cert` to true.

Setting `create_root_cert` to `true` will create this certificate with both `example.com` and `*.example.com` for you, and validate them. (DNS validation).

Setting `create_sub_cert` to `true` will create a certificate **just for the subdomain**, and validate it.

:warning: **Keep in mind that managed certificates will be deleted if stack_destroy is set to true** :warning:

To change a certificate (root_cert, sub_cert, ARN or pre-existing root cert), you must first set the `no_cert` flag to true, run the action, then set the `no_cert` flag to false, add the desired settings and excecute the action again. (**This will destroy the first certificate.**)

This is necessary due to a limitation that prevents certificates from being changed while in use by certain resources.

## Adding external datastore (AWS EFS)
Users looking to add non-ephemeral storage to their created EC2 instance have the following options; create a new efs as a part of the ec2 deployment stack, or mounting an existing EFS. 

### 1. Create EFS
Option 1, you have access to the `create_efs` attribute which will create a EFS resource and mount it to the EC2 instance in the application directory at the path: "app_root/data".

> :warning: Be very careful here! The **EFS is fully managed by Terraform**. Therefor **it will be destroyed upon stack destruction**.

### 2. Mount EFS
Option 2, you have access to the `mount_efs` attributes. Requiring an existing EFS id and optionally a primary security group id the existing EFS will be attached to the ec2 security group to allow traffic.

### EFS Zone Mapping
An example EFS Zone mapping;
```
{
  "a": {
    "subnet_id": "subnet-foo123",
    "security_groups: ["sg-foo123", "sg-bar456"]
  }
}
```

## Made with BitOps
[BitOps](https://bitops.sh) allows you to define Infrastructure-as-Code for multiple tools in a central place.  This action uses a BitOps [Operations Repository](https://bitops.sh/operations-repo-structure/) to set up the necessary Terraform and Ansible to create infrastructure and deploy to it.
