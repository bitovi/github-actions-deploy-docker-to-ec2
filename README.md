# Docker to AWS VM

GitHub action to deploy any [Docker](https://www.bitovi.com/academy/learn-docker.html)-based app to an AWS VM (EC2) using Docker and Docker Compose.

The action will copy this repo to the VM and then run `docker-compose up`.

## Requirements
Your app needs a `Dockerfile` and a `docker-compose.yaml` file.

> For more details on setting up Docker and Docker Compose, check out Bitovi's Academy Course: [Learn Docker](https://www.bitovi.com/academy/learn-docker.html)

For envirnoment variables in your app, provide a `.env` file in GitHub Secrets named `DOT_ENV` and hook it up in your `docker-compose.yaml` file like:
```
version: '3.9'
services:
  app:
    env_file: .env
```

## Example usage

Create `.github/workflow/deploy.yaml` with the following to build on push.

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - "main"

permissions:
  contents: read
  # id-token: write

jobs:
  deploy:
    # environment:
    #   name: github-pages
    #   url: ${{ steps.build-publish.outputs.page_url }}
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - id: deploy
      uses: bitovi/github-actions-deploy-docker-to-ec2@v0.2.0
      with:
        aws_access_key_id: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID}}
        aws_secret_access_key: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY}}
        aws_session_token: ${{ secrets.AWS_SESSION_TOKEN}}
        aws_default_region: us-east-1
        domain_name: bitovi.com
        sub_domain: app
        tf_state_bucket: my-terraform-state-bucket
        dot_env: ${{ secrets.DOT_ENV }}
        app_port: 3000

```

## Made with BitOps
[BitOps](https://bitops.sh) allows you to define Infrastructure-as-Code for multiple tools in a central place.  This action uses a BitOps [Operations Repository](https://bitops.sh/operations-repo-structure/) to set up the necessary Terraform and Ansible to create infrastructure and deploy to it.
