# What
#   This bash script uses Terraform to output the values of environment 
#   variables and store them in a file called bo-out.env. 
#   The script checks if Terraform is being used to destroy the environment, and if not, 
#   it runs Terraform output and removes the quotation marks from the output before storing 
#   it in the bo-out.env file.
# Why
#   The bo-out.env file is used by Ansible to populate variables passed on by Terraform
